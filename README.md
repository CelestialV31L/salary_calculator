# salary_calculator
This is just a simple script to calculate a yearly salary from an hourly wage. It will give you the information of how much tax you will pay, and your salary after taxes.

Instructions:
Make sure you have Python installed. Run `python --version` if you are not sure.

Simply run `python salary_calculator.py` and it will ask you for your hourly wage. It will then convert it into a gross salary, then tell you how much taxes you will pay, and then finally give you the net salary with your taxes subtracted from it.

Instructions for using in a native Linux environment:
```sh
sudo chmod +x salary_calculator.py
sudo ./salary_calculator.py
```
