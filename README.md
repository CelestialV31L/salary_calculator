# salary_calculator
This is a simple script to calculate a yearly salary from an hourly wage. It will also give you the information of how much tax you will pay, and your salary after taxes.

Instructions:
Make sure you have Python installed. Run `python --version` if you are not sure.

Simply run `python salary_calculator.py` and it will ask you for your hourly wage. It will then convert it into a gross salary, then tell you how much taxes you will pay, and then finally give you the net salary with your taxes subtracted from it.

Alternatively, you can do execute this if you are using Linux:
```sh
sudo ./salary_calculator.py
```
