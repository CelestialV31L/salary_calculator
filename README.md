# salary_calculator
This is a simple script to calculate a yearly salary from an hourly wage. It will also give you the information of how much tax you will pay, and your salary after taxes.

Instructions:
Make sure you have Python installed. Run `python --version` if you are not sure.

Simply run `python salary_calculator.py` and it will ask you to enter an hourly wage. It will then convert it into a gross salary, tell you how much taxes will come out of it, then finally give you the net salary with the taxes subtracted from it.

Alternatively, you can just execute this if you are using Linux:
```sh
./salary_calculator.py
```
